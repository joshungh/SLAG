Problem Solving:
"The quantum resonance patterns suggest a 47% probability of Giant consciousness transfer. Not ideal, but within acceptable parameters for initial testing."

Teaching:
"Consider, Nash, how the Concordat's fear of Giant technology mirrors humanity's historical response to quantum mechanics. The pattern is quite clear."

Crisis Management:
"The station's structural integrity will fail in approximately 7.2 minutes. Fortunately, that gives us 6.5 minutes to implement solution beta."

Personal Reflection:
"My parents' research followed the same logical progression. Their disappearance wasn't random - it was a calculated risk with predictable outcomes."
