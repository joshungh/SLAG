# Scene Transition Patterns
- Temporal transitions (time of day, duration)
- Spatial transitions (movement through station)
- Emotional transitions (tension, relief)
- Causal transitions (event chains)

# Examples:
"The lab's emergency lights fade as Chen steps into the corridor, the Fragment's glow still burning in his retinas..."
