Would you like me to:
1. Expand any specific section?
2. Create detailed templates for scene generation?
3. Develop specific technical documentation?
4. Generate character-specific materials?

This guide can serve as a foundation for consistent narrative generation while maintaining the hard sci-fi elements and character authenticity throughout the story.
