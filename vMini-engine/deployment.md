# vMini-engine AWS Deployment Plan

## Current Architecture
- FastAPI backend service
- Redis for caching
- Docker containerization
- AWS Bedrock for LLM services
- Pinecone for vector storage
- Environment-specific configuration support

## Pre-Deployment Security Audit
1. Review and secure sensitive information
   - [x] Store credentials in AWS Parameter Store/Secrets Manager
     - [x] AWS credentials
     - [x] Pinecone credentials
     - [x] Other sensitive configuration
   - [x] Remove AWS credentials from .env
   - [x] Remove Pinecone credentials from .env
   - [x] Create .env.template for reference
   - [x] Update .gitignore
   - [x] Create separate .env.development and .env.production files
   - [ ] Document environment variables in README

2. Environment Configuration Strategy
   - [x] Set up environment detection logic
   - [ ] Configure development-specific settings
   - [ ] Configure production-specific settings
   - [ ] Set up staging environment (optional)
   - [ ] Document environment differences

2. Infrastructure Requirements
   - [ ] AWS account with appropriate permissions
   - [ ] AWS CLI installed and configured
   - [ ] Docker installed and configured
   - [ ] ECR repository for container images
   - [ ] ECS cluster for container orchestration
   - [ ] VPC with public and private subnets
   - [ ] Security groups and IAM roles
   - [ ] Separate AWS resources for each environment

## Deployment Steps

### Phase 1: Local Preparation
1. Environment Configuration
   - [x] Set up AWS CLI and authenticate
   - [x] Create environment-specific .env files
      - [x] development: .env.development
      - [x] production: .env.production
   - [x] Test application locally with AWS credentials
   - [x] Test environment switching
   - [x] Validate environment-specific behaviors

2. Docker Configuration
   - [x] Review and optimize Dockerfile
   - [x] Add health checks
   - [x] Create environment-specific Docker Compose files
   - [x] Test multi-stage Docker builds

### Phase 2: AWS Infrastructure Setup
1. Network Configuration
   - [x] Create VPC
   - [x] Configure public and private subnets
   - [x] Set up internet gateway
   - [x] Configure route tables

2. Security Configuration
   - [x] Create security groups
   - [x] Set up IAM roles
   - [ ] Configure AWS Parameter Store for secrets
   - [ ] Set up AWS WAF (optional)

3. Container Registry
   - [x] Create ECR repository
   - [x] Set up ECR policies
   - [x] Test image push/pull

### Phase 3: Service Deployment
1. ECS Setup
   - [x] Create ECS cluster
   - [x] Configure task definitions
   - [x] Set up service discovery
   - [ ] Configure auto-scaling

2. Database and Cache
   - [ ] Set up ElastiCache for Redis
   - [ ] Configure backup policies
   - [ ] Set up monitoring

3. Load Balancing
   - [ ] Configure Application Load Balancer
   - [ ] Set up target groups
   - [ ] Configure health checks

### Phase 4: Monitoring and Logging
1. Observability Setup
   - [ ] Configure CloudWatch logs
   - [ ] Set up CloudWatch metrics
   - [ ] Create CloudWatch dashboards
   - [ ] Set up alarms

2. Performance Monitoring
   - [ ] Configure X-Ray tracing
   - [ ] Set up performance metrics
   - [ ] Create performance baselines

### Phase 5: Testing and Validation
1. Deployment Validation
   - [ ] Test API endpoints
   - [ ] Validate story generation
   - [ ] Check logging and monitoring
   - [ ] Test auto-scaling
   - [ ] Validate security measures

2. Load Testing
   - [ ] Create load test scenarios
   - [ ] Test concurrent story generation
   - [ ] Validate resource scaling
   - [ ] Monitor performance metrics

## Rollback Plan
1. Immediate Rollback Steps
   - Document previous working version
   - Procedure for reverting ECS tasks
   - Database rollback process

2. Recovery Procedures
   - Service restoration steps
   - Data recovery process
   - Communication plan

## Cost Estimation
- [ ] Calculate estimated monthly costs
  - ECS cluster costs
  - ElastiCache costs
  - Load balancer costs
  - Data transfer costs
  - AWS Bedrock usage costs
  - Pinecone usage costs

## Documentation Requirements
1. Deployment Documentation
   - [ ] Infrastructure diagrams
   - [ ] Configuration details
   - [ ] Security protocols
   - [ ] Monitoring setup

2. Operation Documentation
   - [ ] Maintenance procedures
   - [ ] Backup and recovery
   - [ ] Scaling procedures
   - [ ] Incident response

## Next Steps
1. Review this plan with team
2. Prioritize tasks and create timeline
3. Set up development and staging environments
4. Begin with Phase 1 implementation
